      I’m Caryl Letada (She/They). I love playing sports, 
      especially taekwondo and won a lot of medals during my previous tournaments.
      I also excel in dancing, which was really my passion when I was a kid, 
      and I am also a part of the organization of the tamaraw broadcasting network 
      at FEU High School.

      I'm Angel Erece (she/her) from Q.C., Manila. 
      I am a FEU Senior Highschool Grade 11 student, part of the STEM strand.
      I am a person who's open to try new things and loves adventure.
      I find morning/afternoon to be particularly enriching, 
      as it allows me to breath fresh air, clear my mind of things, 
      and be one with nature, while listening to music provides a 
      welcome to me respite from the demands of my school work.

      I am Jasmine Lucas (she/her) from Manila, Philippines. 
      I was a member of the Sci-Math Organization before, which taught me to develop my problem-solving skills
      and helped me balance my time between studies and extracurriculars. I’ve competed at district and
      provincial levels in the past. And now I am no longer part of this organization. 
      Currently, I am a member of eureka Science Organization under research committee, 
      which I believe will help me enhance my knowledge about science.

      I am Shaira Sudaria (She/her) from Manila, Philippines. 
      I am dedicated and an honest person. I was a member of a dance organization before, 
      which taught me all about discipline. It also allowed me to boost my confidence through 
      the several dance competitions we have joined. In my free time, I usually read, watch or sleep.
