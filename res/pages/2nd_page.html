    <h1>Where does Earthquake come from?</h1>
        <p> The earthquakes originate in tectonic plate boundaries. The focus is a point inside the earth where the earthquake started, sometimes called the hypocenter, and the point on the surface of the earth directly above the focus is called the epicenter. </p>
		<p> There are two ways by which we can measure the strength of an earthquake: magnitude and intensity. Magnitude is proportional to the energy released by an earthquake at the focus. It is calculated from earthquakes recorded by an instrument called a seismograph. It is represented by Arabic Numbers (e.g. 4.8, 9.0). Intensity, on the other hand, is the strength of an earthquake as perceived and felt by people in a specific locality. It is a numerical rating based on the relative effects of people, objects, the environment, and structures in the surrounding. The intensity is generally higher near the epicenter. It is represented by Roman Numerals (e.g. II, IV, IX). In the Philippines, the intensity of an earthquake is determined using the PHIVOLCS Earthquake Intensity Scale (PEIS). </p>
